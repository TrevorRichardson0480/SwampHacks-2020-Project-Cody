# SwampHacks-2020-Project-Cody-
This was my groups project from SwampHacks 2020. Initially was not planning to do a project and I was just focusing on workshops. But this is what we ended up with. This is the Arduino file of our project, which involved electrical components to make a little game for kids with mental disabilities.
